            <p>My daughter Caitlyn found Baxter in the "shy cats" room in a shelter in Providence, RI. It was an open room with cubby holes, and all the cats in there got along fine but were a bit nervous around humans. Cait was looking for a timid cat because her precious kitty who she adored was a "scaredy cat" who took awhile to warm up to people but once he did, he was incredibly loving. So when Cait laid eyes on Baxter (named Popey by the shelter), she was smitten, even though he wanted nothing to do with her lol.</p> 
               <p>She decided that despite his aversion, he showed no signs of aggression and that in time she could build his trust. That day she took him home. He was eleven months old. The first month Baxter basically lived in the bathroom. Since he was so uneasy it was important that he start with a small space and get adjusted to the new environment. The bathroom was off the bedroom and eventually he came out to explore, and pretty soon he even came on the bed for snuggles! Since then Baxter has filled Cait's life with loud purrs and love.</p> 
               <p>He feels so safe and happy at home in Denver, CO with her, my other daughter Mindy, and Mindy's cat Star. Though he has a wide selection of toys, his favorites are always resourceful things such as shoelaces and earplugs! He's ventured out of his comfort zone, much thanks to his cousin's brave example, and now goes outside in a harness on a leash. But he never cries to go out and is quite content being an indoor kitty 99% of the time, watching the world from his full-length glass door.</p>
