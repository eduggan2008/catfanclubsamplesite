            <p>Star was born May 3, 2016 in the rural town of Elko, Nevada. For the first 4 months of her life she was and outdoor cat (I assume), then living in a shelter. Her owner, my daughter Mindy, with the wonderful financial help and support of her family, traveled to Elko, NV for a job and was given the familial help to adopt a cat to keep her company.</p>
            <p>Star was shy, and had a depressed look with no alertness or personality in her shelter cage. She didn't look at, or sniff or pay attention to anyone. Day one at picking out cats, Mindy met a different cat as Star did not seem interested. Day two Mindy came back, not feeling connected to the first cat, and asked to meet Star outside of her cage. Instantly there was a beautiful connection. Star was playful, silly, and had a great personality. Mindy knew she had to save Star from that cage.</p>
            <p>The vet and paperwork process wasn't working out, as Star could not be adopted until after Mindy's dad left town, and no one could pick Star up due to minimal shelter hours. Mindy's Dad saved the day, and made it so Star could come home with Mindy on September 3, 2016. Once in a home, she roamed around and explored everything like it was a whole new world! She spent all day, night, and weekend licking Mindy's face and hands, cuddling across her neck, and showing how loving she is.</p>
            <p>Star is a love bug. Kisses and cuddles all the time. But she's also a crazy girl, and a predator. She loves outdoor time to watch the animals, and she's kept safe on a leash to prevent her from running in the road or being eaten by a Coyote. Mindy watches her carefully on the leash, and also has a walking leash and Star walks around the neighborhoods.</p>
            <p>Star lived in Elko Nevada for 10 months, then traveled in a car 2600 Miles to Rhode Island, where Mindy and her sister Cait grew up. She lived there for 7 months. Star did not seem to enjoy the humidity or the environment in RI, and acted out often. She has now, in December 2018, lived in Denver, CO (another car road trip - 2,000 Miles) for over a year and she loves it. She has a cousin, Baxter, and they live together now. Star was mean to him at first because of jealousy / territorial personality, most likely. But they have such different personalities that it makes them match perfectly. Star is so happy in Colorado and loves her new friend (cousin). MEOW</p>
